## Module-1: Modernizing Traditional Java Applications

This shows you how to take a traditional Java EE app, and compile it to run in a lightweight Java container. The app weâ€™ve chosen is an old Java EE demo called Movie Plex 7 that was originally written to run in Wildfly 3. You can find our fork of the repo in our javaee-demo repository on GitHub. In fact, if you were to take that repository, and lift the movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT file, you could run that in a Java Application Server, such as WebLogic, Wildfly, or WebSphere.

Execute the ./mta_java_module1 script on PWD Platform. Done

## Module-2: Adding a New Front End

As you saw earlier, the JavaServer Faces client was rather sparse and old-fashioned looking. You want to make the movie listing to include movie posters as well as more information about each movie. To do that, you will add a few attributes to the Movie entity, and include a path to a movie poster, and more information about the cast and the movie rating.

Execute ./mta_java_module2 script
